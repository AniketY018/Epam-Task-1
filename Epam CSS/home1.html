                <h1>Vintage Virat Kohli takes India to memorable win vs Pakistan</h1>
                <h4>Posted on Apr 08, 2023</h4>
                <h3>Virat Kohli single-handedly powered India to an epic four-wicket win over arch-rivals Pakistan with
                    a magnificent 53-ball 82 not out in their big-ticket T20 World Cup game on Sunday. Pakistan
                    recovered from a wobbly start to post a fighting 159 for eight. India completed the chase in the
                    last ball, with Kohli and Hardik Pandya (40) doing the bulk of the scoring after a horror start to
                    their innings. The two revived India with a 113-run stand for the fourth wicket after they were
                    reeling at 31/4 at one stage. Get live cricket score updates of match between India and Pakistan.

                <h1>Substantial changes made in personal income tax in Budget, new tax regime now more attractive, says
                    FM'</h1>
                <h4>Posted on Apr 08, 2023</h4>
                <h3 style="padding-right: 50px;">Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced a number of changes in the income tax slabs in the new
                    tax regime. If we include all rebates, an individual will have to pay no tax on income up to Rs 7
                    lakh in the new tax regime. Addressing the post-Budget press conference, Sitharaman said that the
                    government has made the new income tax regime more attractive for taxpayers and has thus brought
                    about 'substantial changes' in its structure for the benefit of the middle class. She noted that the
                    country has been waiting for a direct tax regime which is simplified and easy in compliance.

                    An individual with annual income of Rs 9 lakh will have to pay only Rs 45,000 as tax in the new
                    regime. This is only 5% of a taxpayer's income in the new regime. There is a standard deduction of
                    Rs 52,500 in the new tax regime. The FM also said that the new tax regime would be the default
                    regime.

                <h4>Posted on Apr 08, 2023</h4>
                <h3>The Chandrayaan-3 mission, which had been scheduled for the third quarter of 2022, has been moved to
                    June 2023 by the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO). Chandrayaan-3 will launch on the
                    Geosynchronous Launch Vehicle Mark-3, according to ISRO Chairman S. Somnath.

                    A more competent lunar rover will be on Chandrayaan-3 to enable seamless interplanetary exploration.
                    Around the end of 2024, ISRO also intends to conduct successful flight tests and abort missions with
                    crew members aboard.

                    In September 2019, the Vikram lander from the Chandrayaan-2 mission crashed onto the moon’s surface,
                    ending India’s first effort to deploy a rover there.</h3>
